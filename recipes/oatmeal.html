    <h4>Oatmeal: The perfect minimal effort breakfast!</h4>
    <p>
            Let's face it, we've all had our fair share of rushed mornings lately. With the go go go of modern life the last thing I want to do is spend a lot of time preparing breakfast.
         I have places to be, preferably outside of the kitchen! This is where oatmeal has come to save the day for me. The following recipe can be considered a baseline template to add to and modify to 
         your tastes. I personally love strawberry but maybe you are more of a blueberry person? Maybe you prefer a dairy free meal to start the day? All modifications are welcome!
