    <h4>Oatmeal: The perfect minimal effort breakfast!</h4>
    <p>
        Let's face it, we've all had our fair share of rushed mornings lately. With the go go go of modern life the last thing I want to do is spend a lot of time preparing breakfast. I have places to be, preferably outside of the kitchen! This is where oatmeal has come to save the day for me (literally).
